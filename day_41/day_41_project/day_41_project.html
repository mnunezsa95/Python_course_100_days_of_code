<h1>The TV Shows According to Marlon</h1>

<h2>My top 3 tv shows all-time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>The Wire</h3>
<p>Documents the war on drugs from different prespectives: the cops, the drug-dealers, the city, and the school system</p>

<h3>Sopranos</h3>
<p>Mobster classic! Highly recommended if you like old school shows.</p>

<h3>Breaking Bad</h3>
<p>Super slow in season 1, but it picks up and will have you on edge.</p>
