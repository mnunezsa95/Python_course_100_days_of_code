## How does the internet actually work?

1. The client (users) send a request (using domain) to the ISP (Internet Service Provider)
2. The ISP sends the request to the DNS (Domain Name System)
3. The DNS looks up the domain and retrieves the IP Address
4. The DNS sends the IP address back to the ISP, which then sends it back to the client
5. The user can now make a direct request to the IP address (the server).
6. The server will now send back the data files to render the website.

## How do Websites Work?

### Browser & Code Files

- Browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, etc) are used to look an IP address and recieve data from the server that is rendered into websites
- The data recieved from the server are typicall HTML, CSS and JavaScript
  - HTML is the structure of the website
  - CSS is used to style the websites
  - JavaScript is used to add behavior to the website

### What is HTML?

- HTML means HyperText Markup Language
- HTML defines the structure of the website
- HTML uses tags (<></>) to render add content to a website
  - Different tags do different things
